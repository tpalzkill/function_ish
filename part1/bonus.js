/*
The purpose of this challenge is to be able to encrypt and decrypt a string using the Caesar Cipher.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

Each letter has a numeric representation called an ASCII code. For example, the letter "a" has an ASCII code of 97 and the letter "b" has an ASCII code of 98.

See http://www.asciitable.com/

For this problem, you can safely assume you'll just be working with lowercase letters. (i.e. codes 97 to 122)

To convert letters to ASCII codes and ASCII codes back to letters, check out these methods:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode

The Caesar Cipher works like this:

- If you get a string, such as "a", convert it to a number: 97
- Add 13 to that number: 110
- Figure out what character that number represents: 110 => "n"
- So the final result is that "a" becomes "n"

If you add 13 to an ASCII code and it's greater than 122 (i.e. "z"), you'll need to wrap back around to the start of the alphabet. See the tests for context.

It'll take a few steps to solve this cipher. Have fun!

// Define a function named caesarAdd13 that takes one argument, a number
// If the number is less than 97
//    Throw an error with the message "Doh!  Too low.": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw
// If the number is greater than 122
//    Throw an error with the message "Doh!  Too high.": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw
// If that number+13 would be greater than 122 (the ASCII code for "z")
//    Return a number that is "wrapped" around
// Otherwise
//  Return the number plus 13
//
// Example: caesarAdd13(97) => 110
// Example: caesarAdd13(110) => 98



// Define a function named caesarSubtract13 that takes one argument, a number
// If the number is less than 97
//    Throw an error with the message "Doh!  Too low.": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw
// If the number is greater than 122
//    Throw an error with the message "Doh!  Too high.": https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw
// If that number-13 would be less than than 97 (the ASCII code for "a")
//    Return a number that is "wrapped" around
// Otherwise
//  Return the number minus 13
//
// Example: caesarSubtract13(97) => 110
// Example: caesarSubtract13(110) => 98



// Define a function named encodeChar that takes a single argument: a 1-character string
// Return the encoded version of that string
//
// HINT: which of your functions would you use to encode the character?
//
// See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt



// Define a function named encodeMessage that takes a single argument: a string
// Return the encoded version of that entire string, according to these rules:
//   - if the character is not a letter, just keep it as is.
//
// Example: "Hello, there!" => "uryyb, gurer!"
//
// HINT: you'll need a loop for this
//



// Define a function named decodeMessage that takes a single argument: a string
// Return the decoded version of that entire string, according to these rules:
//   - if the character is not a letter, just keep it as is.
//
// Example: "uryyb, gurer!" => "Hello, there!"



// SUPER BONUS
// Figure out how to maintain the case of the letters, so that "Hello, there!" becomes "Uryyb, gurer!" and vice-versa
// Change the tests in order to make this happen
